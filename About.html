    Rice ball bites are a smaller, bite-sized version of traditional Japanese rice balls known as onigiri. <br>
    Typically made from seasoned or plain rice, they are shaped into small, compact balls or other <br>
    shapes like triangles. They can be filled with a variety of ingredients such as tuna, salmon, <br>
    pickled plum (umeboshi), or vegetables, and are often wrapped in a piece of nori (seaweed).
<br><br>
    These bites are a convenient and portable snack or meal option, commonly enjoyed during picnics, <br>
    lunchboxes, or as an appetizer. They're easy to customize with different flavors and fillings,<br>
     making them popular for those who enjoy Japanese cuisine or want a healthy and satisfying snack.<br>
